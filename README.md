# NBA-team-optimization

NBA Team optimization with PuLP solver. 

### Project Description ###
The objective of the project was to apply optimization techniques to interesting and
practical real-life problems. The project requires to formulate a problem as an optimization problem, solve
the problem using a suitable software (i.e, PuLP, Gurobi etc), and interpret the results obtained in the context of the
problem.

### Objective ###
The current project aims to find the mix of NBA players that maximizes team efficiency as
per Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and other metrics while optimizing the cumulative
roster cost using a dataset on NBA players data in 2017. Moreover, this project explores
other potential avenues for optimization such as mining for undervalued players based on
their performance worth. Of course, certain features like teammate chemistry canâ€™t be
modeled, and thus are not factored into the optimization problem. Statistically speaking
however, the team that plays most efficiently for the lowest cost is the ideal roster that
an NBA general manager seeks.
